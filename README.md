# SMsim
A general C++ software for multirotor flight simulation and obtaining design parameter for multirotor preliminary design

## Goals and objectives
This repository is in the initial stages of development and its purpose is to develop a quadrotor flight dynamics simulator for the purposes of neural network training and implementations of control and guidance algorithms and possibly obtaining the design parameters of a quadrotor.
This software has adapted many of its data structures and algorithms from JSBSim flight simulator software.
Those interested in the development of this repository are greatly appreciated.
